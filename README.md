# Galaxy Model
2D Galaxy model following the theoretical description in [Reid et al (2019)] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03357). Note that this is not an exact copy of Reid 2019, but rather "best-effort imitation", with minor additions and modifications due to differences in programming languages and research purposes.

The following packages are required for this module to work:

- `descartes`
- `matplotlib`
